name is a unique identifier for Color Picker widget.

placeholder is text to show in the editor when there is no value. A common use of this is a search box that says in faint gray italicized text "Search..." which disappears as soon as the user starts to edit the text box. This is a useful alternative to a caption if you are constrained in space and asking for something simple of the user.

index

tab index attribute specifies the tab order of an element. You can use this property to change the default tabbing order for widget access using the tab key. The value can range from 0 to 32767. The default is 0 and -1 makes the element non-focusable.

NOTE: In Safari browsers, by default, Tab highlights only text fields. To enable Tab functionality, in Safari Browser from Preferences -> Advanced -> Accessibility set the option "Press Tab to highlight each item on a webpage".

key

shortcut key property specifies a shortcut key to activate/focus an element. (\* [below for details](#shortcut))

**Value**

is the default value to display value for an editor widget. Note that the display value is just what the user sees initially, and is not always the dataValue returned by the widget.

Only

this checkbox property prevents the user from being able to change the data value of a widget.

determines whether or not a component is visible. It is a bindable property.

on Demand (visible only when show property is bound to a variable)

this property is set and show property is bound, the initialization of the widget will be deferred till the widget becomes visible. This behavior improves the load time. Use this feature with caution, as it has a downside (as we will not be able to interact with the widget through script until the widget is initialized). When show property is not bound the widget will be initialized immediately.

the disabled property is true (checked) the value of the editor cannot change. The widget becomes display-only.

**\*Shortcut key**: The shortcut key property specifies a shortcut key to click the button. The way of accessing the shortcut key is varying in different browsers:

key Trigger

Explorer

\[Alt\] + shortcut key

\[Alt\] + shortcut key (_/Linux_)

\[Control\] \[Alt\] + shortcut key ()

\[Alt\] \[Shift\] + shortcut key (_/Linux_)

\[Control\] \[Alt\] + shortcut key ()
